#  Distributed Systems 2021&mdash;Miniproject 3

## Guide on how to run

Depending on how many _Front Ends_ (_FE_) (which includes the clients) and how many servers that is wished for, the following commands will depend upon. The general example that is showcased below includes two _FE_ and three servers. 

### Setting up nodes

In seperate terminal windows insert from within the folder `../replicaNode` to run the primary and backup servers:

```pwsh
go run . -name s1 -port 9000 -ips 9001:9002
```

```pwsh
go run . -name s2 -port 9001 -ips 9000:9002
```

```pwsh
go run . -name s3 -port 9002 -ips 9000:9001
```

The FE (and client) is inserted in the folder `../frontEndNode` and run via the following commands: 

```pwsh
go run . -name node1 -address localhost -port 5000
```

```pwsh
go run . -name node2 -address localhost -port 5001
```

### Crashing a node 

<pre>
<b>üí° The premise is that any server node may crash ‚Äï however, this happens only once.</b>
</pre>

The auction time is set to one minute, and within this one minute one of two events can occur:

1. A backup server replica crashes.
2. The primary server crashes.

To initiate any of these two events, press `ctrl+c` in the respective wanted server that should crash.

### What to submit on learnit

* A **single** zip-compressed file containing: a folder src containing the source code. You are only allowed to submit source code files in this folder.

* A file report.pdf containing a report (in PDF) with your answers; the file can be **at most** 5 A4 pages (it can be less), font cannot be smaller than 9pt. The report has to contain 4 sections (see below for a detailed specification of the report format). The report cannot contain source code (except possibly for illustrative code snippets).

* (Optional) a text file log.txt containing log(s).

## A Distributed Auction System

You must implement a **distributed auction system** using replication: a distributed component which handles auctions, and provides operations for bidding and querying the state of an auction. The component must faithfully implement the semantics of the system described below, and must at least be resilient to one (1) crash failure.

### API

Your system must be implemented as some number of nodes, possibly running on distinct hosts. Clients direct API requests to any node they happen to know (it is up to you to decide how many nodes can be known). Nodes must respond to the following API:

<pre>
  <br>    <b>Method:</b> bit()
  
      <b>Inputs:</b>  amount (an int)
      <b>Outputs:</b> ack
      <b>Comment:</b> given a bid, returns an outcome among {fail, success or exception}
    
</pre>

<pre>
  <br>    <b>Method:</b> result()

      <b>Inputs:</b>  void amount (an int)
      <b>Outputs:</b> outcome
      <b>Comment:</b> if over, it returns the result, else highest bid
    
</pre>

### Semantics

Your component must have the following behaviour, for any reasonable sequentialisation/interleaving of requests to it:
  
* The first call to "bid" registers the bidder.
* Bidders can bid several times, but a bid must be higher than the previous one(s).
* After a specified timeframe, the highest bidder ends up as the winner of the auction.
* Bidders can query the system in order to know the state of the auction.

### Faults

* Assume a network that has reliable, ordered message transport, where transmissions to non-failed nodes complete within a known time-limit.
* Your component must be resilient to the failure-stop failure of one (1) node.
* You may assume that crashes only happen _‚Äúone at a time‚Äù_; e.g., between a particular client request and the system‚Äôs subsequent response, you may assume that at most one crash occurs. However, a second crash may still happen during subsequent requests. For example, the node receiving a request might crash. On the next request, another node in the system might crash.

### Report

Write a report of at most 5 pages containing the following structure (exactly create four sections as below):

* Introduction. A short introduction to what you have done.
* Protocol. A description of your protocol, including any protocols used internally between nodes of the system.
* Correctness 1. An argument that your protocol is correct in the absence of failures.
* Correctness 2. An argument that your protocol is correct in the presence of failures.

### Implementation

* Implement your system in GoLang. We strongly recommend that you reuse the the frameworks and libraries used in the previous mandatory activites.
* You may submit a log (as a separate file) documenting a correct system run under failures. Your log can be a collection of relevant print statements, that demonstrates the control flow trough the system. It must be clear from the log where crashes occur.
